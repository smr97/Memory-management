# Memory-management

The conventional malloc() function in C is both processor intensive and reduces determinism in case of Real Time embedded systems. Hence this implementation of a static sized memory pool will be further modelled into an API for the same.

# Instructions for testing

Simply compile and execute. Read the code to understand how the memory is being allocated.
